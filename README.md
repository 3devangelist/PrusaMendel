I have made these because i can, and i love history! and is a historic printer!

My motivation is make a printer with a printer, i have a [*Beethefirst+*](https://beeverycreative.com/beethefirstplus/), that is **portable** and **user friendly** and i wanted to prove that with that Little machine i could create a bigger one! and more maker oriented.
That is the base of REPRAP movement!

You will have all the gcode already generated to print one just like me in you beethefirst! and if you do **Show me!**

## First technical notes about these printer

These printer is not easy to assemble, have a lot of bolts and hardware, but if well assembled it can be reliable.
You have a calibration paragraph, as a guide for you to calibrate all the perpendicularity of your XYZ axis.
I have printed the majority parts in PETG because my BTF+ (beeverycreatrive printer) prints it very well and is more flexible than PLA to absorb some vibrations and have better layer adhesion.

**Side note** if you use PETG try to use one that is transparent the color opaque ones normally as worse strength proprieties.


## Modeling
I have use **BLENDER**, because i am a blender hardcore-user, because i can, and because is really good to edit meshes.

I have used rhino to cut pieces, because is the only paid CAD program i have, but you can use the dxf or you can ask to me and i can convert to your needs, and to bee fair the only part you have to cut with precision is the Y wood base, for that you have these PDF


## Changes

- New X axes;
- remodeled Y;
- Some updates on Z;
- Bowden for extruder;
- E3d v6 hotend;
- Igus sliders for X and Y;
- board MKSgen 1.4;
- Drivers X, Y, E, Trynamic 2100, Z LV8729;
- Added LEDs to the system, you can add RGB "if you do show it!"

Working..


## BOM Build of Materials

[Spreedsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16tOSJMvPqgqwrDMo-RX5avmmjWwADpJSkYPEsrkDC4U/edit?usp=sharing)
(only parts to be printed the parts to buy needs to be updated)

## Extruder

These is the best bowden printed extruder i have used! was developed by a great friend [Michael Memeteau](https://incompreendido/in/mmemetea/), creative and resourceful engineer.
These extruder as a concept of double the area of adherence of the tooth to the filament.
I have edited the model to fit a MK10 tipe of gear if you want other please edit it yourself, you have a editable [onshape instance](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5c209690b10748338481382a/w/6d6638f54420d7c76fe7949d/e/2d47f4694787414fab59244e)

### Filament Sensor

To implement!


## Hotend
I have used a Bowden setup with E3d v6 Chinese clone, before all the test I am thinking to upgrade it for a original one!

## Wiring

You should be able to assemble with these [instructions](http://reprap.org/wiki/MKS_GEN) from reprap community, if you use LEDs you should connect to the 12V output is the same place you connect the hotend fan.
