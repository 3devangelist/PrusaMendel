I have made these because i can, and i love history! and is a historic printer!

## Modeling
I have use blender, because i am a blender hardcore-user, because i can, and because is really good to edit meshes.
I have used rhino to cut pieces, because is the only paid CAD program i have, but you can use the dxf or you can ask to me and i can convert to your needs.

These is the best bowden printed extruder i have used! was developed by a great friend [Michael Memeteau](https://incompreendido/in/mmemetea/), creative and resourceful engineer.
These extruder as a concept of double the area of adherence of the tooth to the filament.
I have edited the model to fit a MK10 tipe of gear if you want other please edit it yourself, you have a editable [onshape instance](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5c209690b10748338481382a/w/6d6638f54420d7c76fe7949d/e/2d47f4694787414fab59244e)

### Filament Sensor

To implement!


## Hotend
I have used a Bowden setup with E3d v6 Chinese clone, before all the test I am thinking to upgrade it for a original one!
